Some programs might be uploaded to pastebin to download it directly to computercraft
very easily.
Just write `pastebin get <id> <name>` where `<id>` is the ID on pastebin <sub><sup>(it says next to the title, if it is `<todo>` then it hasn't uploaded yet)</sup></sub> and `<name>` is a filename you wish to save in.

 minccweeper [`aY3iP8SF`][pb mineccweeper] <sub>(WIP)</sub>
-------------
This is a game based on minesweeper.

 ccbash [`<todo>`][pb ccbash]<sub>(WIP)</sub>
--------
This is a shell based on the bash shell.

 labyrinth [`MJS1fywR`][pb labyrinth]<sub>(WIP)</sub>
-----------
This is based of [illacceptanything/illacceptanything/labyrinth](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/tree/master/labyrinth). This is a labyrinth made in a filesystem/git/github repo.
This program should let you "explore" it inside of ComputerCraft.
It includes the labyrinth from github in the program, but there will be a way to use the files so multiple can be used easily.
